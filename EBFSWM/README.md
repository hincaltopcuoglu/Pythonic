Entropy Based Feature selection method implemented with multiprocessing.

Source for entropy calculations with python is : https://winder.ai/entropy-based-feature-selection/

I just want to show how we can deal with bigdata when we face feature selection step. Because there may be thounsands of columns and billions of raws. So please evaluate this code from that aspect of view.

Thanks.
